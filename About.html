<h1>Brief History</h1>
            
<p1>
        A dream of providing computer education of the founder, Cresencio B. Buenarte became a reality when Megabyte College came into existence in 1985. Its main purpose is to be of service to Computer Education to meet the growing needs of computer literates in our province most especially in the 2nd District of Pampanga.

        From its humble beginning, it was named Megabyte Computer Technology Resource Center, which was housed at the 3rd Floor, Joli Building, Plaza Burgos, Guagua, Pampanga. For its initial offerings (1) Computer Short-term courses as Basic Programming, Assembler, Fortran Database, WordStar, Multiplan and (2) Vocational Courses as Typewriting and Stenography.
    
        In 1994 Megabyte Computer Technology Resources Center was changed into Megabyte Institute of Technology Foundation, Inc. to further strengthen its services and curricular offerings. Additional programs were offered: Two-year Computer Secretarial, Two-year Associate in Computer Science, Advanced Short-Term Courses.
    
        It was 1997 when Megabyte College of Science and Technology was renamed. It was able to acquire ownership of its present site in Sto. Cristo, Guagua, Pampanga and Mabical, Floridablanca and started putting up its own building. The modern concrete buildings include administrative, teaching, sports and recreational facilities. Thus, Megabyte College environment become more conducive to learning.
    
        With the noble aim of making the school more responsive to the changing needs of the community, the administration with the diligent effort and guidance of Dr. Filipinas A. Buenarte continues to its growth and success.
    
        At the moment, the school does not only offer computer-related courses but also offers Pre-Elementary, Elementary, Secondary, and Tertiary level courses.
    
        The school seeks to lead students gain world-class competence in the area they can best utilize their human talents and resources through a well-planned curricular and co-curricular programs, effective and efficient instruction, quality support services and functional research.
    
        Megabyte College proves its worth by the success of its graduates who passed the board examination and lands job after graduation.
